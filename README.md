# SUPER-HEROES_CODE_CHALLENGE

Super-Heroes code challenge is a challenge based on Ruby on Rails meant to check the concept of creating an API with Rails.

## Description

The code challenge is based on Ruby on Rails ,from the creation of Rails API,performing or APIs CRUD actions [ POST,PATCH,GET,GET/id] ,the active record models,and their associations, creation of migrations,creation of routes [resources],validation of our models to prevent invalid data to be stored in the database,controllers to include the routes actions and lastly consuming the API using our client (in our context we'll use Postman and Chrome browser).

## Code-Challenge-Setup-Instructions

 1)Installation of the Visual studio code .
 2)Git cloning the repository . 
 3)install the API dependancies by running `bundle install`. 
 4)Then run `rails db:migrate db:seed` for the migrations to run and seed data to database.
 4)After all the dependancies have been installed run `rails s` or `rails server`to start the server.
 5) Consume the API using the Chrome browser or Postman which is considered the best choice for performing all the CRUD operations required.
